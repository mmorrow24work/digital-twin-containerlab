I see the issue! The official FRR image is based on Alpine Linux, not Ubuntu/Debian, so we need to use the correct Alpine package names. Let me fix the Dockerfile:Now I've updated the guide to work correctly with Alpine Linux (which is what the official FRR image uses). Here's a summary of the key changes made:

## Key Fixes for Alpine Linux:

1. **Package names corrected**:
   - `apt-get` → `apk add`
   - `snmp`, `snmpd` → `net-snmp`
   - `snmp-mibs-downloader` → not available in Alpine (optional)
   - Added `bash` for shell compatibility

2. **Directory structure updated**:
   - `/var/lib/snmp` → `/var/lib/net-snmp`
   - Added `/var/log/snmp` for Alpine

3. **User management**:
   - Added Alpine-specific user creation commands
   - More defensive permission settings

4. **SNMP configuration simplified**:
   - Removed some Debian-specific directives
   - Simplified `agentXPerms` directive for Alpine compatibility

Now you can rebuild your image with:

```bash
docker build -t frr-snmp:v7.5.1 .
```

The corrected Dockerfile should build successfully on Alpine Linux. The main difference was that Alpine uses different package names than Ubuntu/Debian - `net-snmp` instead of separate `snmp` and `snmpd` packages.

If you still encounter any package issues, you can check what SNMP packages are available in Alpine with:
```bash
docker run --rm frrouting/frr:v7.5.1 apk search snmp
```

** AI Prompt : the Dockerfile in Step 1 and Step 6 are different - please double check everything

You're absolutely right! Let me check and ensure consistency throughout the entire document. I can see there are inconsistencies between Step 1 and Step 6.Perfect! I've completely rewritten the guide to ensure absolute consistency throughout all steps. Here's what I've fixed:

## Key Consistency Issues Resolved:

1. **Dockerfile identical in Step 1 and Step 6**: Both now use the exact same Alpine-compatible Dockerfile

2. **Package names consistent**: All references now use Alpine packages (`net-snmp`, `apk add`, etc.)

3. **Startup script consistent**: Step 5 and Step 6 have identical startup scripts

4. **Configuration files consistent**: All config files in Step 6 match the explanations in earlier steps

5. **Troubleshooting updated**: All debugging commands now reflect Alpine Linux specifics

## Main Changes Made:

- **Alpine packages**: `net-snmp`, `net-snmp-tools`, `net-snmp-dev` instead of Debian packages
- **Directory paths**: `/var/lib/net-snmp` instead of `/var/lib/snmp`
- **User management**: Alpine-specific user/group creation commands
- **SNMP daemon path**: Direct `snmpd` call (Alpine puts it in PATH)
- **Log locations**: Updated for Alpine system logging differences

The guide is now completely consistent from Step 1 through Step 9, and should build successfully with the Alpine-based official FRR image. You can now run:

```bash
docker build -t frr-snmp:v7.5.1 .
```

And it should work without the package errors you encountered earlier.
