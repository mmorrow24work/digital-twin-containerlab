This project remains work in progress so it will be updated on a regular basis.

The initial project scope is to build a digital twin environment with a focus on the core and edge of NRTS2 / NRTS3 network which can be discovered and managed by a generic SNMP manager.

I started off using Kathara but now I’ve moved on to Containerlab – which is a Nokia sponsored open-source project - it's like Kathara but way better – so I expect Containerlab will be our digital twin environment of choice going forward.

At the same time I am also learning how to use GitHub, Docker, AI, and Azure.

I'm using the [issues](https://github.com/mmorrow24work/digital-twin-containerlab/issues) log in to track progress and capture requirements.

I will also use a blog - but I'm not sure how best to to that yet - the recommended options are :

1. Start simple with README for essentials.
1. Use Wiki if you want quick multipage docs/blog with minimal setup.
1. For professional blogging, invest in GitHub Pages with Jekyll/Hugo.
1. Keep blog and docs content in source control to track history.
1. Link blog prominently from README and Wiki for ease of discovery.

I will be using AI as much as possible to accelerate things - here's an example of my interactions with [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) - see [frr-snmp README]([https://github.com/mmorrow24work/digital-twin-containerlab/blob/main/frr-snmp.md](https://github.com/mmorrow24work/digital-twin-containerlab/blob/main/docker_custom_image/frr-snmp/readme.md)).

For the record - here are some links to various resources, I will be using and referring to going forward... [FRRouting github](https://github.com/FRRouting), [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev), [docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [Kathara homepage](https://www.kathara.org/), [KatharaFramework github](https://github.com/KatharaFramework), [containerlab-io-draw github](https://github.com/srl-labs/clab-io-draw), [Nokia SR Linux Streaming Telemetry Lab](https://github.com/srl-labs/srl-telemetry-lab)
