This project remains work in progess so it will be updated on a regular basis.

The initial project scope is to build a digital twin environment with a focus on the core and edge of NRTS2 / NRTS3 network which can be discovered and managed by a generic SNMP manager.

I started off using Kathara but now I’ve moved on to Containerlab – which is a Nokia sponsored open-source project - it's like Kathara but way better – so I expect Containerlab will be our digital twin environment of choice going forward.

At the same time I am also learning how to use GitHub, Docker, AI, and Azure.

I'm using the issues log in to track progress and capture requirements.

I will also use a blog - but I'm not sure how best to to that yet - the recommended options are :

1. Start simple with README for essentials.
2. Use Wiki if you want quick multipage docs/blog with minimal setup.
3. For professional blogging, invest in GitHub Pages with Jekyll/Hugo.
4. Keep blog and docs content in source control to track history.
5. Link blog prominently from README and Wiki for ease of discovery.

I will be using AI as much as possible to accelerate things - here's an example of my interactions with https://claude.ai/
