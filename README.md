This project remains work in progress so it will be updated on a regular basis.

The initial project scope is to build a digital twin environment with a focus on the core and edge of NRTS2 / NRTS3 network which can be discovered and managed by a generic SNMP manager.

I started off using Kathara but now I’ve moved on to Containerlab – which is a Nokia sponsored open-source project - it's like Kathara but way better – so I expect Containerlab will be our digital twin environment of choice going forward.

At the same time I am also learning how to use GitHub, Docker, AI, and Azure.

I'm using [ISSUES](https://github.com/mmorrow24work/digital-twin-containerlab/issues) to track progress and capture requirements, and I'm using this [BLOG](https://github.com/mmorrow24work/digital-twin-containerlab/blob/main/BLOG.md) to record my progress for now. 

I will be using AI as much as possible to accelerate things - here's an example of my interactions with [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) - see [frr-snmp AI interaction](https://github.com/mmorrow24work/digital-twin-containerlab/blob/main/docker_custom_image/frr-snmp/AI.md)

For the record - here are some links to various resources, I will be using and referring to going forward...
