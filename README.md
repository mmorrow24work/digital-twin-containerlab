I see the issue! The official FRR image is based on Alpine Linux, not Ubuntu/Debian, so we need to use the correct Alpine package names. Let me fix the Dockerfile:Now I've updated the guide to work correctly with Alpine Linux (which is what the official FRR image uses). Here's a summary of the key changes made:

## Key Fixes for Alpine Linux:

1. **Package names corrected**:
   - `apt-get` → `apk add`
   - `snmp`, `snmpd` → `net-snmp`
   - `snmp-mibs-downloader` → not available in Alpine (optional)
   - Added `bash` for shell compatibility

2. **Directory structure updated**:
   - `/var/lib/snmp` → `/var/lib/net-snmp`
   - Added `/var/log/snmp` for Alpine

3. **User management**:
   - Added Alpine-specific user creation commands
   - More defensive permission settings

4. **SNMP configuration simplified**:
   - Removed some Debian-specific directives
   - Simplified `agentXPerms` directive for Alpine compatibility

Now you can rebuild your image with:

```bash
docker build -t frr-snmp:v7.5.1 .
```

The corrected Dockerfile should build successfully on Alpine Linux. The main difference was that Alpine uses different package names than Ubuntu/Debian - `net-snmp` instead of separate `snmp` and `snmpd` packages.

If you still encounter any package issues, you can check what SNMP packages are available in Alpine with:
```bash
docker run --rm frrouting/frr:v7.5.1 apk search snmp
```
